re helps you to organize to organize you weekly reports,
It is customizable through a global and local config file,

Invoking the application without any arguments will open a
work report for the current week in **$EDITOR**.

A weekly report consists of a template with three sections. You should
fill them accordingly:

**[GREEN]**::
   Used to describe finished tasks, or the status of ongoing operation.
   This is where most of the items of your daily work report should
   probably go.

**[AMBER]**::
   Signifies that an item requires feedback or input from management,
   but does not block you in a significant way.

**[RED]**::
   Signifies a blocking or urgent issue that needs to be addressed
   by management immediately.

OPTIONS

**-w _<number>_**::
    opens the week number of the current year.

If an optional message is provided, the message is added to 
one of the sections of the report. The default section is GREEN. 
If the first word of the message is an all uppercase RED, AMBER, 
or GREEN then this is used as a section name.
If the message text does not start with one of '*', '+', '-', or ' '
then a '*' prefix will be added in attempt to produce a bullet list.
